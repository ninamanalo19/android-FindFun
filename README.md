# android-FindFun
FindFun is an open source experimental project for both Native and React-Native app development (soon).

My Android checklist for now:

- [x] Room
- [x] Hilt
- [x] Data Binding
- [x] Navigation
- [x] Retrofit
- [ ] Safe Args (I already did before, but I'll try to sneak it in this project)
- [x] Data Binding via Adapter
- [ ] Rows and Columns (Jetpack Compose)
- [ ] Espresso Testing

Note: To those who are cloning my project (yes, I see you 👀), please let me know if there are things that I need to improve. I need some feedback, please! 😃
